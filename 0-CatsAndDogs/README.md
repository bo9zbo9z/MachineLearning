### Cats and Dogs

These notebooks use the beginning Cat and Dog classification.  I used this to show multiple ways to train a model and also one with using a mask.

- CatsAndDogs_Training_Transfer – uses transfer learned from a pre-trained model
- CatsAndDogs_Mask – is forked from the TensorFlow Segmentation example (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/segmentation)
- CatsAndDogs_Training – trains the model from scratch

There are MANY different examples of the Cats and Dog classifier, but these have common threads so it should be easy to move between notebooks to understand basic concepts.
