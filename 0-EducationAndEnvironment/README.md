### Education and Environment

These notebooks were created to help me learn how something worked.  For example, to learn tf.datasets, I created “Orig_TFDatasets_V1” notebook.  If I was writing a blog, these are ones I would start with...so I'd start with these before you run the other notebooks.

These are meant to be copied and reused.

You will see copies of some of these in other subdirectories.  These were good starting points and I copied & repurposed many of these to help with understanding data and training options.  

If I need to learn something I usually create a small notebook to demonstrate to concept, and if it is robust enough I keep the notebook around for future usages.
