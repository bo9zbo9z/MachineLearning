### Kaggle Competition Identifying Eye Disease

When Kaggle hosts a competition, there are usually a few things that you have to figure out.  For this one, the data was the main trouble area.  That is why you will see two notebooks.  One that analyzes the images and the other that trains and creates a model.  

I had some challenges converting my prior work to TF 2.x and using graphs.  You will see the comments in the Training notebook.

I used Google Colab for all of this work.
