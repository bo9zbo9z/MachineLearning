### Lib Files

The “TrainingUtils.py” contains several shared methods and one class.  (The class is used for global parms.)

The other subdirectory contains several files that can be used for loss and metrics.  Not all of these have been tested, and the txt file is only for examples.  All of these files were taken from other work, references are at the top of the files.  Some I have migrated to TF 2.x, some are specific to a Kaggle competition, but any usage of these should be verified before importing into your work..

As I read various articles, I started keeping track of ones that I liked.  Most of the time you can use the built in TF loss ad metrics, but with the Kaggle competitions, you usually have to use other approaches.  If you want to read more, just follow the links or search on authors.

This was the best way I found to keep track of what I read and ones I used in the notebooks.....
